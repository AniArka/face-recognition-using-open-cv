# face-recognition-using-open-cv

This project is a face recognition attendance system that uses OpenCV, NumPy, and the face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces in a webcam feed. It captures frames from the webcam, detects faces, and matches them against a set of known faces.

## Prerequisites
* Python (version X.X.X)
* OpenCV (version X.X.X)
* NumPy (version X.X.X)
* face_recognition 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AniArka/face-recognition-using-open-cv.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd project

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy face-recognition

## Usage
1. Open the folder named imageattendance in the project directory.

Place the images of the individuals whose attendance you want to track inside the imageattendance folder. Each image should contain a single face.

2. Run the application:

python main.py

3. The webcam feed will open, and faces detected in real-time will be compared against the known faces provided. If a match is found, the person's name will be displayed on the screen.

4. Press the q key to exit the application.

## Configuration
No additional configuration is required for this project.
